eBPFDevSecTools

eBPFDevSecTools is a collection of tools and frameworks to help developers and operators maintain the lifecycle of their eBPF programs, providing correctness and safety guarantees that enables confident adoption and deployment of 3rd party eBPF programs.

eBPFDevSecTools’ ensemble of tools comprises of:

OPENED: A flexible framework that developers can use to extract and extend on functionality from 3rd party programs.
eBPF Registry: A descriptive catalog of open source eBPF projects providing useful meta-data to help understand the functionality, requirements and properties of these projects.
CodeQuery: A user-friendly user interface for querying the eBPF Registry.
ClientSDK: An interface for inspecting and programming arbitrary map data structures.
We are actively working to broaden the landscape of use-cases supported eBPFDevSecTools and to grow our community of developers and supporters. We welcome all interested to contribute or to reach out.
